# Books

For this coding test I have used the google books api, in the unauthenticated version. So, the first activity shows a book list, 
but you must first populate it performing a search operation.

Use the FloatingActionButton for show the keyboard and start typing immediately. 

Data are handled using a database (Room). Queries and UI updates are handled with a combination of LiveData and ViewModels.

I'd like to use also Paging library, but I haven't use yet, so I need more time to improve my kwoledge about it.

Books api logic is implemented in a Worker.

Worker, Viewmodel, Room and Livedata are some Android Jetpack components that I have used for in this project.
